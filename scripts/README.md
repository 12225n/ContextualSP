# Attention

This eval function is from the official dataset repo https://github.com/taoyds/sparc. If there is any update from them (e.g. fix a minor bug or support for execution exact match), you could replace these files using the latest script. However, it is worth noting that you should adapt the SQL evaluator in `models/metrics.py` to the latest interface.
